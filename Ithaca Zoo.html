  <title>The Ithaca Zoo</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>We're so excited to share our love of animals with our neighbors, and we
    hope you come visit soon. Whether you stop by once while you're passing
    through town or come multiple times a week, you'll find the Ithaca Zoo is
    ready to welcome you with open arms.</p>
  <p><em>Advisory:</em> due to upcoming hot weather, we advise all guests to
    make sure they bring sunscreen for protection from ultraviolet rays and a
    water bottle to help stay hydrated. We have water fountains all over the
    zoo where you can fill up. Just look for the signs that say "Watering Hole."
  </p>
  <h2>Events</h2>
  <p>Our next event is the Red Panda Meet and Greet, where you have a chance to
     meet our favorite little bundles of joy, Red and Fluffy. This will take
     place next Saturday from 1:00-4:30 PM. There will be a line, so come early.

  <h2>About the Zoo</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>The Ithaca Zoo is New York’s premier hillside zoo, and fun for the
      whole family.</li>
    <li>Founded in 1972, we've proudly hosted tourists from 37 countries and
      thousands of local visitors from Tompkins county.</li>
    <li>For over 45 years, we've been committed to our primary mission:
      conservation and protection.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Our Animals</h2>
  <p>We host a wide variety of animals in climate-controlled biomes designed to
    perfectly match their natural environments.</p>
  <p>Our many viewing platforms and walkways provide incredible views
    of our animals but keep guests at a safe distance.</p>
  <p>This is to keep you safe from them, and them safe from you.</p>
  <p>However, there are a few animals that are safe for you to feed
    in supervised sessions.</p>
  <p>Just look for the happy zookeeper sign along edge of the enclosure to
    learn about the time and location for these opportunities.</p>
  <h2>Main Attractions</h2>
  <p>In addition to our wonderful animals, the zoo includes a fully functional
    food court featuring some of Ithaca’s best chefs.</p>
